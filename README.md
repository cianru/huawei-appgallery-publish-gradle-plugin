The plugin allows you to publish the android release build file (*.apk or *.aab) to the Huawei AppGallery.

For publication the plugin used [Huawei Publish API (v2)](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/development/AppGallery-connect-References/agcapi-appid-list_v2)

# Adding the plugin to your project

in `./app/build.gradle`

```
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral() // or jcenter()
    }

    dependencies {
        classpath "ru.cian:huawei-publish-gradle-plugin:<LAST_RELEASE_VERSION>"
    }
}
```
<details>
<summary>Snapshot builds are also available</summary>

<p>
You'll need to add the Sonatype snapshots repository:

```kotlin
buildscript {
    repositories {
        maven { url 'https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots' }
    }

    dependencies {
        classpath "ru.cian:huawei-publish-gradle-plugin:<LAST_SNAPSHOT_VERSION>"
    }
}
```
</p>
</details>

```
apply plugin: 'com.android.application'
apply plugin: 'ru.cian.huawei-publish'

huaweiPublish {
    instances {
        release {
            credentialsPath = "$rootDir/huawei-credentials-release.json"
            buildFormat = "apk"
            ...
        }
        debug {
            credentialsPath = "$rootDir/huawei-credentials-debug.json"
            buildFormat = "apk"
            ...
        }
    }
}
```

Plugin supports different settings for different buildType and flavors.
For example, for `demo` and `full` flavors and `release` buildType just change instances like that:
```
huaweiPublish {
    instances {
        demoRelease {
            credentialsPath = "$rootDir/huawei-credentials-demo-release.json"
            buildFormat = "apk"
            ...
        }
        fullRelease {
            credentialsPath = "$rootDir/huawei-credentials-full-release.json"
            buildFormat = "apk"
            ...
        }
    }
}
```

File `huawei-credentials.json` contains next json structure:
```
{
  "client_id": "<CLIENT_ID>",
  "client_secret": "<CLIENT_secret>"
}
```
Credentials you should get at Huawei AppGallery Developer Console ([Creating an API Client](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/development/AppGallery-connect-Guides/agcapi-getstarted#Creat_Client)).

# Features

The following features are available:

* Publish APK in Huawei AppGallery and auto submit it on all users after getting store approve
* Different settings for different configurations build types and flavors

The following features are missing:

* Publish Release Build on a part of users (Huawei Store doesn't support)
* Change App Store Information: description, app icon, screenshots and etc.

# Usage 

Gradle generate `publishHuaweiAppGallery*` task for each buildType configuration those have `debuggable=false` option.
```
android {
    buildTypes {
        release {
            debuggable false
            ...
        }
    }
}
```

**Note!** Before uploading build file you should build it. Be careful. Don't publish old build file. 
 
```
./gradlew assembleRelease publishHuaweiAppGalleryRelease
```

or 

```
./gradlew bundleRelease publishHuaweiAppGalleryRelease
```

You can override each plugin extension parameter dynamically by using CLI params. For example:

```
./gradlew assembleRelease publishHuaweiAppGalleryRelease \
    --no-publish \ 
    --credentialsPath="/sample1/huawei-credentials.json" \
    --buildFormat="apk"
```
