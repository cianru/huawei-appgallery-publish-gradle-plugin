The plugin allows to publish the android release build files (`*.apk` and `*.aab`) to the Huawei AppGallery by use official [Huawei Publish API (v2)](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/AppGallery-connect-References/agcapi-obtain_token-0000001158365043)

:construction: _That's unofficial plugin. We made it for ourselves and are sharing it for you._

# Compatibility
The Android Gradle Plugin often changes the Variant API,
so a different version of AGP corresponds to a specific version of the current plugin

# Adding the plugin to your project

in application module `./app/build.gradle`

## Using the Gradle plugin DSL

```
plugins {
    id("com.android.application")
    id("ru.cian.huawei-publish-gradle-plugin")
}
```

## Using the `apply` method

```groovy
buildscript {
    repositories {
        gradlePluginPortal()
    }

    dependencies {
        classpath "ru.cian:huawei-publish-gradle-plugin:<PLUGIN_VERSION>"
    }
}

apply plugin: 'com.android.application'
apply plugin: 'ru.cian.huawei-publish-gradle-plugin'
```

      debug {
          ...
      }
  }
}
```
</details>

Also the plugin support different buildType and flavors. 
So for demo and full flavors and release buildType just change instances like that:
```kotlin
huaweiPublish {
    instances {
        create("release") {
            ...
        }
        create("demoRelease")
            ...
        }
        create("fullRelease")
            ...
        }
    }
}
```

# Plugin usage

Gradle generate `publishHuaweiAppGallery<*>` task for all BuildType and Flavor configurations.

:warning: **Note!** The plugin will publish already existed build file. Before uploading you should build it yourself. Be careful. Don't publish old build file. 
 
```bash
./gradlew assembleRelease publishHuaweiAppGalleryRelease
```

or 

```bash
./gradlew bundleRelease publishHuaweiAppGalleryRelease
```

# CLI Plugin Configuration

You can change plugin configuration by CLI. There are all the same parameters as in the plugin gradle configuration. 
CLI params are more priority than gradle configuration params.

```bash
./gradlew assembleRelease publishHuaweiAppGalleryRelease \
    --credentialsPath="/sample-kotlin/huawei-credentials.json" \
    --deployType=publish \
    --buildFormat=apk \
    --publishTimeoutMs=600000 \
    --publishPeriodMs=15000 \
    --releaseTime="2025-10-21T06:00:00+0300" \ 
    --releasePhaseStartTime=2020-11-13T08:01:02+0300 \
    --releasePhaseEndTime=2020-11-20T15:30:00+0300 \
    --releasePhasePercent=5.0 \
    --releaseNotes="en_EN:/home/<USERNAME>/str/project/release_notes_en.txt;ru_RU:/home/<USERNAME>/str/project/release_notes_ru.txt" \
    --appBasicInfo="/sample-kotlin/app-basic-info.json"
```

# Examples

<details>
<summary>Example  uploading build file without publishing</summary>

You can upload the build file as draft without submit on users.

From gradle build script:
```groovy
huaweiPublish {
    instances {
        release {
            credentialsPath = "$rootDir/sample1/huawei-credentials.json"
            deployType = "draft"
        }
    }
}
```

or execute from command line:

```bash
./gradlew assembleRelease publishHuaweiAppGalleryRelease \
    --credentialsPath="$rootDir/sample1/huawei-credentials.json" \
    --deployType=draft
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Example publishing AppBundle</summary>

If you choose AppBundle see [Application Signature](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/service/josp/agc/index.html#/myApp/101338815/9249519184596012000) before using the plugin.

From gradle build script:
```groovy
huaweiPublish {
    instances {
        release {
            credentialsPath = "$rootDir/sample1/huawei-credentials.json"
            buildFormat = "aab"
        }
    }
}
```
or execute from command line:

```bash
./gradlew assembleRelease publishHuaweiAppGalleryRelease \
    --credentialsPath="$rootDir/sample1/huawei-credentials.json" \
    --buildFormat=aab
```

After uploading build file the Huawei Service will start processed. It may take 2-5 minutes, depending on the size of the software package.
While publishing the AppBundle build file you can get the error:
>What went wrong:
> Execution failed for task ':app:publishHuaweiAppGalleryRelease'.
> Ret(msg=[cds]submit failed, additional msg is [The file is being processed.
> It may take 2-5 minutes, depending on the size of the software package.])

When publishing an AppBundle the service takes some time to parse the file.
In this case, the plugin uses a special mechanism for the full cycle.
By default, the plugin tries to publish the assembly every 15 seconds for 10 minutes.
To change values see using parameters: `publishTimeoutMs` and `publishPeriodMs`.

For more information see the [Issue#7](https://github.com/cianru/huawei-publish-gradle-plugin/issues/7)
and [Issue#38](https://github.com/cianru/huawei-publish-gradle-plugin/issues/38).

<details>
<summary>Example publishing with release phase</summary>

You can upload the build file and submit it on the part of users.

From gradle build script:
```kotlin
huaweiPublish {
    instances {
        release {
            credentialsPath = "$rootDir/sample1/huawei-credentials.json"
            releasePhase {

                percent = 10.0
            }
        }
    }
}
```

or execute from command line:

```bash
./gradlew assembleRelease publishHuaweiAppGalleryRelease \
    --clientId=<CLIENT_ID> \
    --clientSecret=<CLIENT_SECRET> \
    --releasePhaseStartTime=2020-11-13T08:01:02+0300 \
    --releasePhaseEndTime=2020-11-20T15:30:00+0300 \
    --releasePhasePercent=10.0
```

While publishing with release phase you can get the error:
>Execution failed for task ':app:publishHuaweiAppGalleryRelease'.
>Update App File Info is failed. Response: UpdateAppFileInfoResponse(ret=Ret(code=204144644, msg=[AppGalleryConnectPublishService]call cds to query app information failed))

I asked Huawei support. They confirmed the server issue. To work around this problem you should once set
the release phase for uploader build from Developer Console. After that plugin should publish next builds without this error.
(Sorry for RU screenshot interface locale. Huawei doesn't allow me to change it on EN)

One more note. If already there is published version that waiting for review you'll get error:

>What went wrong:
>Execution failed for task ':app:publishHuaweiAppGalleryRelease'.
>Update App File Info is failed. Response: UpdateAppFileInfoResponse(ret=Ret(code=204144647, msg=[cds]update service failed, additional msg is [The new service has can't be edited service,which can't be updated!]))

# Known Huawei Publishing API Issues

List of known problems and solutions with the plugin and Huawei AppGallery API that users of the plugin have encountered: 

* I use correct `client_id` and `client_secret` but get [Huawei AppGallery Connect API - 403 client token authorization fail](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63999681/huawei-appgallery-connect-api-403-client-token-authorization-fail)
* There is no way to publish build to open testing track in AppGallery. See [issues/34](https://github.com/cianru/huawei-publish-gradle-plugin/issues/34)
* You can't upload and publish the same version twice if you publish with submition on users first time. Second one you will get the error:
```bash
Task :app:publishHuaweiAppGalleryRelease FAILED

Execution failed for task ':app:publishHuaweiAppGalleryRelease'.
> Update App File Info is failed. Response: UpdateAppFileInfoResponse(ret=Ret(code=204144647, msg=[cds]update service failed, additional msg is [The new service has can't be edited service,which can't be updated!]))
```
* Huawei Developer Console doesn't save list of countries from previous release. To fix that just use `appBasicInfo` param with json `{"publishCountry": "BY,MD,RU,AM,AZ,GE,KZ,KG,MN,TJ,TM,UZ"}`. For more info see parameter description and [issue/41](https://github.com/cianru/huawei-appgallery-publish-gradle-plugin/issues/41).      

# FAQ
<details>
<summary>Support the same [Triple-T](https://github.com/Triple-T/gradle-play-publisher) Release Notes catalogs structure.</summary>

___

It's a bad idea to use the same file structure from thirtparty project
because my plugin will be strongly depended on however my project even doesn't
use it directly. If the `Triple-T` will change catalogs or files structure
it leads to a bug into my plugin.

Instead of I created a flexible settings for my Release Notes params.
You can reuse the release notes files of Triple project. 
See `removeHtmlTags` param description to remove html tags from Google Play release notes. 
For example:
```groovy
huaweiPublish {
    instances {
        release {
            releaseNotes = new ru.cian.huawei.publish.ReleaseNotesExtension(
                [
                    new ru.cian.huawei.publish.ReleaseNote(
                            "en-En",
                            "$projectDir/src/main/play/release-notes/en-En/default.txt"
                    ),
                    new ru.cian.huawei.publish.ReleaseNote(
                            "ru-RU",
                            "$projectDir/src/main/play/release-notes/ru-RU/default.txt"
                    ),
                    new ru.cian.huawei.publish.ReleaseNote(
                            "de-DE",
                            "$projectDir/src/main/play/release-notes/de-DE/default.txt"
                    ),
                    new ru.cian.huawei.publish.ReleaseNote(
                            "tr-TR",
                            "$projectDir/src/main/play/release-notes/tr-TR/default.txt"
                    ),
                    new ru.cian.huawei.publish.ReleaseNote(
                            "pt-BR",
                            "$projectDir/src/main/play/release-notes/pt-BR/default.txt"
                    ),
                ], 
                true
            )
        }
    }
}
```

In addition, Google and Huawei use different country codes. 
To quickly compare them, you can use a little trick 
that [@rtsisyk](https://github.com/rtsisyk) came up with

```groovy
huaweiPublish {
  instances {
    huaweiRelease {
      credentialsPath = "$rootDir/huawei-appgallery.json"
      buildFormat = 'aab'
      deployType = 'draft' // confirm manually
      releaseDescriptions = []
      def localeOverride = [
          'am' : 'am-ET',
          'gu': 'gu_IN',
          'iw-IL': 'he_IL',
          'kn-IN': 'kn_IN',
          'ml-IN': 'ml_IN',
          'mn-MN': 'mn_MN',
          'mr-IN': 'mr_IN',
          'ta-IN': 'ta_IN',
          'te-IN': 'te_IN',
      ]
      def files = fileTree(dir: "$projectDir/src/google/play/release-notes",
          include: '**/default.txt')
      files.each { File file ->
        def path = file.getPath()
        def locale = file.parentFile.getName()
        locale = localeOverride.get(locale, locale)
        releaseDescriptions.add(new ru.cian.huawei.publish.ReleaseNote(locale, path))
      }
      releaseNotes = new ru.cian.huawei.publish.ReleaseNotesExtension(releaseDescriptions)
    }
  }
}
```
